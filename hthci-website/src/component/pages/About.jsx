                  is a Nigerian American non-governmental organization working
                  to improve the academic outcomes of youth in rural communities
                  and the overall public health in these communities by working
                  under the guidelines of these sustainable development goals:
                  good health and well-being, quality education, gender
                  equality, and clean water and sanitation. Many factors affect
                  quality education and health so HTCHIâ€™s projects cover diverse
                  areas that we believe can improve the literacy and health of
                  our partner communities. We are an organization of trained
                  individuals in the areas of healthcare, education,
                  engineering, and computer science putting our skills to uplift
                  our communities. Our current partner community is Lejja,
                  Nsukka LGA in the state of Enugu. We are looking forward to
                  partnering with more communities in the future.
