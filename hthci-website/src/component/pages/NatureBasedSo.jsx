        <h2>Nature Based Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          We tackle socio-environmental issues by leveraging nature to address various issues.
          Our solutions aim to safeguard biodiversity and reduce barriers to good health and well-being. 
          Our current nature based solutions project target sanitation, as it is a major contributor to 
          the overall public health in our partner community. Houses still lack toilets or proper waste 
          collection sites. We plan to implement decentralised wastewater treatment projects that use low-cost 
          solutions to improve sanitation in the community. We install decentralised wastewater treatment 
          that can treat black water thereby reducing barriers to good health and well-being.
          We will begin implementing the Evapotranspiration Tanks in Nigeria this year by building a proof of concept.
          With your support, you will assist us to implement theoretical and practical workshops on Evapotranspiration 
          Tanks for black water treatment in the communities we serve in Nigeria.
