        <p>
          The privatization of healthcare and poor-quality public healthcare in Nigeria offers barriers to 
          health services especially to individuals in rural settings. HTHCI organizes annual health screenings
          and workshops on good health practices to rural population. These activities give community residents 
          an opportunity to know their current health status and learn ways to improve their well-being.

          We are searching for collaborators and organizations in Nigeria and the diaspora who want to partake in our
          yearly health screening and education. Individual collaborators must provide verifiable professional credentials
          as healthcare service providers. We will be hosting annual health screening and health education workshops this year. 
          Your support enables us to assist our collaborators in getting to and within Nigeria, accommodating collaborators, 
          and purchasing resources required for the health screenings and workshops.
