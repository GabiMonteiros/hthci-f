        <p>
            Sanitation is a major contributor to the overall public health of
            our partner community. Houses still lack toilets or proper waste
            collection sites. Our decentralized wastewater treatment projects
            use low-cost solutions to improve sanitation in the community. We
            install decentralized wastewater treatment that can treat gray and
            black water thereby reducing barriers to good health and well-being.
