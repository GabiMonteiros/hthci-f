            activities within the after-school tutoring aims to support our youthsâ€™ learning process with homework assistance, 
            test preparation, and technology-based activities especially during times of frequent teacher strikes in Nigeria.

            In 2025, we plan to organise our first Digital Literacy Program (DLP). DLP will occur during the long vacation of 
            school over a period of 4 weeks. During this time, students will learn how to proficiently operate and troubleshoot
            digital tools on a hardware and software level (computer, cell phones, applications etc), how to use digital tools 
            to create original work (programming, media etc), and safe practices on digital platforms.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Your support will assist us with contracting instructors, buying digital tools and offering the DLP to our participants at no cost.
