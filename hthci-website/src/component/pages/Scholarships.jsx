          awards scholarships to deserving students in primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education, 
          to further aid their academic pursuits. Scholarships are awarded by recognition or competitively.
          The criteria include good academic standing and recommendation letters from trusted individuals who 
          can speak on applicantâ€™s academic performance, behaviour, and community engagement. 

          We aim to sponsor 12 students a year. Scholarship recipients will be provided with financial aid for 
          one full academic year, learning materials, and room & board. Your support enables us to provide scholarships
          to deserving students to continue their academic endeavours.
